# Ultrasonic-Sensor-and-Screen
In this task, we used an LCD screen and an Ultrasonic sensor. Because Tinkercad does not have Bluetooth modules the circuit was connected traditionally. The LCD screen was used to showcase if the tablet screen work or not. When the ultrasonic sensor detects an object it counts to three seconds and checks if the object is within range. if the object leaves the counter will reset.
